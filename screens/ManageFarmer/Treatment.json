Apply nitrogen to leaves that have fallen to the ground in the fall to enhance decomposition of fallen leaves and make them more palatable to earthworms. Hand apply a liquid fish solution or 16-16-16 fertilizer to help with the decomposition. Shred fallen leaves in the fall with a mower to help speed up decomposition. Prune your apple trees to open up branching and allow more air circulation. When watering your apple trees avoid getting foliage wet.Apply dolomitic lime in the fall after leaf drop to increase pH and to help reduce fungal spores in the spring.Spray fungicide – Bonide Captan wettable sulfur summer lime sulfur or Spectracide Immunox. when temperatures are above 60 degrees and the leaves or blooms are wet."
